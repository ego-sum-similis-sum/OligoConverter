# OligoConverter

Oligo Converter is a small desktop application to convert oligonucleotide sequences (max length = 100nt).
Enter a sequence in the Query field (5' to 3' direction), select the conversion checkboxes you need and click the Convert button.
The result of the conversion is shown in the Result field.

Possible conversions:
- Capitalize or change to lowercase.
- Complement sequence
- Convert DNA <--> RNA
- Reverse sequence

This tool is useful when designing PCR primers and you need the complementary sequence (of the reverse primer),
when you need to convert a siRNA sequence to it's DNA equivalent, or when you need to capitalize sequences for database entry.

The application is written in Delphi
